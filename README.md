# Products with Good Taste in User Experience

Products I've collected that have excellent user experience, with explanations for why.

- **BoldVoice**: Accent reduction software. BoldVoice excels in emotional design and learning system design.
- **myiq.com**: Excellent user experience with smooth payment using Apple Pay. It charges you $1 for viewing results and $17.44 for a weekly subscription. Good scam strategy.
